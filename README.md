# Explanation
In this repository, I document my learning progress.  
This may include anything scripts, complete programs, or just explanations for specific cases.

# Structure
I’ve organized everything by programming language whenever possible.  
In some cases, multiple languages are involved.

This script finds the greatest common divider (GCD) of two numbers.

### searchSomething
In this folder, I compare different search algorithms on lists.

### listVsQueue
